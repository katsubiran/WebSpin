AvRack2.exe is an executable file associated with the Realtek ALC655 AC'97 Audio software, published by Dell Technologies, and is typically found on systems that utilize this audio hardware. While it is a legitimate component of the audio drivers for certain Dell computers, users may sometimes confuse it with malware due to its file name. Generally, AvRack2.exe is safe to run if it originates from a trusted source; however, it is advisable to ensure that it is located in the correct directory, as malware can sometimes disguise itself with similar names.

To maintain system security, regular scans with updated antivirus software are recommended to detect any potential threats.
